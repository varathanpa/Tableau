Advanced geographical maps
Excellent sharing and publishing

Tableau Limitation
-------------------
1.Though the Tableau very rich in visulization, unlike powerbi, custom visuals cannot be import...it has to recreated
2.developer should have same screen resolution as viewer otherwise the format may get disturbed
3.Only a viz tool...For data cleaning and other data preparation activities...need tool like "Tableau Prep"
4.Tableau Server which can  $175,000 for an 8 core option and $35 dollars per user. Alternatively, you can use Tableau Online which is limited but is $35 per user. This can accumulate if you are trying to have a large number of users access reports.
5.From tableau 2019 can display upto 50 values as columns and 50 values as row, before that only 16 columns
6.No automatic schedule refreshing of reports
7.Apply same formating for multiple files...no feature is avaialble..have to format each field separately

Challanges
----------
1.display only 16 columns...create  2 sheets with 16 each...create a dasboard with 2 sheets side by side or below to one another
2.Tableau Desktop is unable to render more than 1 million panes in a single view.
   Error "not enough memory to display ... rows and ... columns" Creating Crosstab View
  Resolution: Filter the data so there are fewer panes in the view. For more information, see Filtering in Tableau Help.
